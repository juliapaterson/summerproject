### **summer project 2019/2020**
2019/2020 internship at mbi

* epsilon machines on human eeg data from shafto and pitts attentional blindness eeg task
* supervised by nao tsuchiya, angus leung, yota kawashima

**week 1 25/11 - 29/11**

* 25/11 - initial setup of matlab/eeglab, data, etc
  + fixed version errors
  + read some more papers about eeg + attentional blindness 

* 26/11 - fixed git, initial matlab/eeglab exploration
  + tracking progress so far in readme doc with [r markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html)
  + [eeglab tutorial](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/Main_Page)
  + exploring shafto eeg data (see images folder)
  + re reference in eeglab (probably unneeded)
  + export variables of interest to new file
  + to do: filter vmrk 
  
* 27/11 - git explosion, vmrk filter
  + fixed git push issue (files too large)
  + explore vmrk filtering + old resources (drive and repo)
  + to do: filter, investigate drive/old repo further
  
* 28/11
  + explore evangeline's IIT code
  + add gitignore for large .mat files, back them up on google drive
  + binarised and exported to txt files median data
  + to do: differentiated txt files had strange values and were large - fix?
  + to do: build epsilon machines for each channel/binarisation methods?, optimise?, check or filter channels and other workspace data
