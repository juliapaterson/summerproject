CSSR started as a thesis from [Kristina Klinkner](kklinkner@gmail.com) and
[Cosma Shalizi](cshalizi@stat.cmu.edu). It is now maintained by
[Sam Stites](sam@stites.io) in close collaboration from Kristina and Cosma.

If you have any suggestions, patches, documentation, wiki pages, bug reports,
test cases, or code that you would care to contribute, we would love to add
you to this list!

provided by SFI's core grants from the National Science Foundation and the
MacArthur Foundation, by the NSF's Research Experience for Undergraduates
program, and by the Dynamics of Learning group, under DARPA contractual
